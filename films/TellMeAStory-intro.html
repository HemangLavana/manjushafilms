        <!-- Brief intro here -->

This was my thesis film when I was studying MFA in documentary 
films at the Documentary Institute of University of Florida. 
The film profiles an unusual friendship between a Jewish oral 
historian and a Japanese MIT Nuclear Physicist as the historian 
helps the physicist recover from depression by sharing memories.
<p>
The film was shown at several oral history seminars and medical 
conferences. It also played at a couple of film festivals on 
ageing and Asian societies.
