        <!-- Brief intro here -->


Fear prevails in Pakistan, as the country battles the 
extremists who terrorize its people and wreak havoc 
across the land. Pakistan's very survival is at stake. 
In this environment of uncertainty, three secular schools
in rural Pakistan choose to focus on their desire for a 
very different future. The feature documentary My Vision 
for Pakistan intimately follows four 5th-graders as they 
paint, sculpt and sketch their vision for their homeland 
in an inter-school art and craft competition.
