Lama Norlha Rinpoche never doubted his teacher; not in 
seven years of meditation retreat, not escaping a 
concentration camp, not crossing the Himalayas on foot, 
and not leaving behind everything familiar to bring his 
faith to NYC. Now, under great threat and with students 
in America, China and Tibet, Rinpoche fights to pass on 
his teacher&apos;s wisdom, Vajrayana or the Diamond Vehicle.

The film profiles the relationship between Lama Norlha 
and his 25-year-old American student Justin as he 
prepares to enter another three year retreat to learn 
Vajrayana. The film featured in Independent Film Week.

        <!-- Brief intro here -->

Wheelchair bound, without a larynx, and diagnosed with a 
life-threatening aortic aneurysm, Dr. Sharadkumar Dicksheet 
now lives only (and barely) so he can travel to India to 
perform free operations in marathon-like surgery sessions 
where up to 700 children receive treatment for their cleft 
lips and other deformities. Although Dicksheet survives off 
of social security while living in his Brooklyn apartment, 
his life is drastically different in India where the 
eight-time Nobel Prize nominee is treated like a living god. 
FLYING ON ONE ENGINE shows how this quirky, funny, and 
sometimes difficult character overcomes his own ailments 
by curing others.
