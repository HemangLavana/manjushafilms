        <!-- Brief intro here -->

The people of South Sudan make history on July 9th, 2011, as Southern Sudan 
celebrates independence as a new Nation. But the birth of this new nation 
may mean military invasion by powerful North Sudan.  Voices of Sudan features 
the recollections of several Lost Boys of Sudan who now live and work in the 
United States as clergymen. The nine part series Voices of Sudan will 
present the hope of a better future for Sudan.
