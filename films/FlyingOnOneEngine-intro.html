        <!-- Brief intro here -->

Wheelchair bound, without a larynx, and diagnosed with a 
life-threatening aortic aneurysm, Dr. Sharadkumar Dicksheet 
now lives only (and barely) so he can travel to India to 
perform free operations in marathon-like surgery sessions 
where up to 700 children receive treatment for their cleft 
lips and other deformities. Although Dicksheet survives off 
of social security while living in his Brooklyn apartment, 
his life is drastically different in India where the 
eight-time Nobel Prize nominee is treated like a living god. 
FLYING ON ONE ENGINE shows how this quirky, funny, and 
sometimes difficult character overcomes his own ailments 
by curing others.
