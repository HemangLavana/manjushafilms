        <!-- Brief intro here -->

One of my earlier films, this is a promotional video 
for Reflections Theater Troupe - a playback theater 
troupe in Shands medical hospital. They are a part 
of University of Florida's Arts in Medicine program 
and they facilitate healing by playing back patients' 
personal stories. The film screened at various medical 
conferences, Arts in Healing seminars and is currently 
being a used by a faculty at UF for her class on 
Theater in Medicine.
