        <!-- Brief intro here -->


<em>Haiti-Six Months After The Earthquake</em> profiles a 76-year-old naked Jain monk as he teaches his
students the secrets of the ancient science of attaining Nirvana. 
The filmmaker Hemal Trivedi spent months in the forests of India with 
the naked monks to learn about their esoteric sub-culture.

Six months after the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti, people are still without 
basic necessities such as clean water. Odyssey Networks film crew travel to the island 
to see the relief projects, as well as the almost overwhelming amount 
of work still remaining.
