        <!-- Brief intro here -->


Lama Norlha Rinpoche never doubted his teacher; not in 
seven years of meditation retreat, not escaping a 
concentration camp, not crossing the Himalayas on foot, 
and not leaving behind everything familiar to bring his 
faith to NYC. Now, under great threat and with students 
in America, China and Tibet, Rinpoche fights to pass on 
his teacher&apos;s wisdom, Vajrayana or the Diamond Vehicle.

The film profiles the relationship between Lama Norlha 
and his 25-year-old American student Justin as he 
prepares to enter another three year retreat to learn 
Vajrayana. The film featured in Independent Film Week.
