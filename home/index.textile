p<>. Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani school girl who was shot by Taliban, became an international 
symbol of freedom.  Her case is only the tip of the iceberg, however, because in some parts 
of Pakistan getting an education is still an act of defiance. Watch Shabeena, a remarkable 
school principal, and her quest to bring education to the children, particularly the young 
girls, living in the shadow of the Taliban on Pakistan's frontier.

"interview":http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2012/12/14/the-story-of-shabeen-zareen-a-brave-school-principal-in-pakistan
